The only really interesting thing to model is the fact that a defect only occured in a very very select amount of requests (1 in 3 million). There wasn't a failure in terms of some subsystem failed, it was just a bug or misconfiguration.

Byzantine Failures - are they successes or failures.

## Expectations:

- Very high number of successes, low number of fails
- `ParseError` is a very small percent of success
- There are 0 `ParseError` in the `fail` row
