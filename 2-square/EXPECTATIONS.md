- split into two parts, the first segment is considered healthy, the second is unhealthy
- 1st segment: `cpu` is hovering around 20%
- 1st segment: `memory` is around 6 million
- 2nd segment: `cpu` slowly starts increasing at tick 4000 to reach about 2 at end of simulation
- 2nd segment: `memory` starts rapildy increasing at tick 4000
- both flatten out at around tick 54000
